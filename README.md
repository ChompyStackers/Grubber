## 👯‍♀️ Clone the Repo 
Clone the repo from the Chompy Stackers Github organization:

▶︎ terminal commands
```
$ bash
$ bundle 
$ yarn
$ rails db:setup
```

## 🏁 Start the Server
▶︎ terminal commands
```
$ bash

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Restaurant Resource    
The Devise User model is going to have an association with the Restaurant model. In this situation, the User will have many Restaurants and the Restaurants will belong to a User.

▶︎ terminal commands          
```
$ bash
$ rails generate resource Restaurant street:text city:text state:text foodtype:text comment:text image:text user_id:integer
$ rails db:migrate
```

### 👩🏽‍🍳 User and Restaurant Associations

class Restaurant < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

**app/models/user.rb**
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  has_many :Restaurants
end
```

## 📈 Testing
rspec will run all tests, to specify, add the file name after the command

▶︎ terminal commands

```
$ bash
$ yarn jest
$ rspec spec/
```
- the syntax for the testing pages will look as such: 

```ruby
import React from 'react'
import { shallow, configure } from 'enzyme'
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'
import FileName from './FileName'
configure({adapter: new Adapter()})
describe("When FileName does something", () => {
    it("does something", () => {
      const newfile = shallow(<AboutUs />)
      const newfileRender = newfile.find("something on the file")
      expect(newfileRender).toEqual("whatever the file contains")
    })
  })
```

## ✈️Deploying Grubber to Heroku
- In order to deploy to Heroku, the main change we need to make in our app is to add the pg gem because Heroku uses PostgreSQL as its database. We can’t use sqlite on Heroku.

### Heroku Errors and TroubleShooting: 
Terminal Error: 
```
Heroku Deployment Error: ModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: Error: Can’t resolve ‘enzyme’ in ‘/tmp/build/app/javascript/components/components’
```
In your package.json: move “enzyme” and “enzyme-adapter-react-16" from devDependencies to dependencies
```
Delete node_modules
Delete yarn.lock
$ yarn
```
### 👾Installing Heroku :
▶︎ Terminal command: 
```
$ bundle install
```
- You also need to make sure you have set up a git repo in your code directory and commit all the changes we made to the code.
- Now let’s create a Heroku app. We just need to run the ▶︎ terminal command: 
```
$ heroku create my-events-app
```
- where my-events-app is the name of the app on Heroku.


- If we don’t pass a name to heroku create, Heroku automatically generates a random name for the app.

- Then let’s push our code to the git repo on Heroku,

▶︎ terminal command: 
```
$ git push heroku master
```
- That’ll take a couple of minutes to deploy. It can take a bit longer the first time because it needs to install all the gems and setup the app.

- Once that’s done, we can open the app in a browser either by typing in the app url or by running the ▶︎ terminal command:
```
$ heroku open
```
- But it won’t work yet because we need to migrate the database first. So let’s run the ▶︎ terminal command:
```
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```
- Let’s also seed the database with some events, run the ▶︎ terminal command:
```
$ heroku run rake db:seed
```
- Now let’s refresh and there’s our Eventlite app running on Heroku!

## Adding Yelp API 

1- We need to add a gem to handle the http request from our server to the target server (in this example we are using Yelp API)

```ruby
# In your gemfile add: 
gem 'httparty'
```
Documentation: https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty

2- We need to add your API key in your credentials.

  - In your terminal run:
```
$ EDITOR="nano --wait" rails credentials:edit
```
It should open a new editor.
 - Using the arrow keys move down to a new line. 
 - Hit return to make a gap between lines. 
 - Type the name of your API key and the key associated with it:. (in this case we are using yelp)
* EXAMPLE: 
 ```ruby
 yelp:
 Access_key_id: <yourkeyhere>
```
 - Hit control+o then return to save (you should seen x lines written)
 - Control+x to exit
* Terminal Commands:
```
$ rails c
$ Rails.application.credentials.dig(:yelp,:access_key_id)
```
 - This should return your api key - _If_ it did not you might have had syntax errors in the nano editor so run those again (Step 2)
 - In our __home_controller.rb__ file we make a new method that __has__ to have a _unique name_
 - (not index - it will run on mount which will break)
 ```
def yelp
       api_key = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:yelp,:access_key_id)
 
       restaurant = HTTParty.get("https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?location=#{params[:location]}&term=#{params[:restaurant]}",headers: {Authorization: "Bearer #{api_key}"})
      
       if restaurant
           render json: restaurant
       else
           render json: restaurant.errors , status:422
       end
   end
```
 - Next we need to make a new route:
```
get 'home/:location/:restaurant', to: 'home#yelp'
```
 - Finally we can connect our backend request with an api endpoint in our front end:
```
readYelpRestaurant = (location, restaurant) => {
     fetch(`home/${location}/${restaurant}`,{
       headers: {
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
       }
     })
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(payload=> this.setState({yelpRestaurant: payload}))
     .catch(errors => console.log("Yelp Restaurant read:", errors))
   }
```
An example of running the method with params looks like below:
```
<button onClick={(e)=>this.readYelpRestaurant(`${this.state.ip.postal}`, 'tacobell')}>Click</button>
```

# Capstone Project Details

**Planning is critical to the success of your project.** Proper planning can help avoid wasting time and ensure your team is successful.

### Prep To Do List [X]

  - [X] Add the instructors
- [X] Create a team Heroku account[Jorge]
  - [X] Be sure to keep track of the username and password as we will need it for deployment
- [X] Decide on Developer Roles

### Green Light Meeting [X]
- [X] Elevator pitch - 30 sec summary of the app [JB]
- [X] Wireframes - visual representations of all the pages your user will see for your MVP [Stephen]
- [X] DB schema drawn out with column names, data types, and table relationships
- [X] CRUD actions [Frank]

### Trello Board [X]  
- [X] Swim lanes[Frank]
- [x] Icebox
- [x] MVP
- [x] Doing
- [x] Code review
- [x] Done

### Team Name [X]
- Chompy Stackers

### Elevator Pitch [X]
The elevator pitch should succinctly explain your project's purpose and functionality.
    - "HAVE YOU EVER NOT KNOWN WHERE TO GO FOR FOOD?" 
    - "YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO!" 
    - "ADD YOUR FAVORITE LOCATIONS AND SHUFFLE THEM TO FIND THE PERFECT PLACE   TO CHOMP DOWN"

### Wireframes [X]
Wireframes are drawings or basic outlines of what each page of your application will look to the user. Wireframes should be vague enough that style choices are not limited, but provide enough information to create an MVP. During development, if there are any questions or disagreements on the look or basic functionality of your app, wireframes can help sort out those issues. A good wireframe will allow the development team to "walk through" the application page by page.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a great tool for wireframing!

### DB Schema
Setting up your database will be one of the first steps in your project. The database schema should be drawn out with the name of each column and the data type of each column. Relationships between each table should be defined.

### User Stories
A user story describes how a user interacts with an app. Stories take your wireframes and DB schema and turn them into actionable items. Stories are a detailed "to do" list for every part of your application. Stories keep the team focused on the overall goal of the application as well as keeping the individual developers on task. There should be a clear understanding of when a story is "done".

### Schedules
The capstone project is two weeks long and can be divided into two one-week (5 day) sprints. The first sprint is getting the basic functionality of your application, or your **Minimum Viable Product**. The second sprint is for adding additional styling and **Icebox** functionality.

A typical day:
```
9:00 - Check in with the class

9:15 - Morning standup with the class
- Project: What tasks did you complete yesterday? What task are you working on today?

9:30 - Check in with your group and discuss the plan for the day
- What story is each person working on?
- What is the goal for the day?
- What story / branch are you currently working on?

9:30 - Pair up and start coding, remember to take breaks regularly and take breaks at the same time

12:00 - Lunch
